Emotional Maps needed a facelift, and after much testing, it seems that I have reached that point where I can be fairly satisfied with my "artwork" and how it works. 

From now on, I will do a few simple tweaks of styles, and go little by little informed of any updates. 

The changes that I will be at the server level as I am evaluating apps that allow resource balancing (HAProxy something style) and perhaps enable memcache, because I want to optimize the speed of response. 

Well nothing more to report, I say goodbye ...

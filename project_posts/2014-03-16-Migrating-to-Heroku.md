I'm migrating the project to Heroku, the new link is [https://emotional-maps.herokuapp.com/](https://emotional-maps.herokuapp.com/)

Appfog is not good for production projects (at least in the new Free Account), for this reason I'm migrating the project, and the results are satisfactory for now.

Apologize for the inconveniences

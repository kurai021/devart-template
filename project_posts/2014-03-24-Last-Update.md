Today I decided to finish this job, still wait until a day before the deadline to make my work as completed.

I just fixed a small detail in the responsive, I think it is ready for deliver.

I hope the day of deliverym Twitter has much more activity to make Emotional Maps an amazing and beautiful visual piece and help us to recognize what kinds of social beings we are, nothing more to say... just thanks to all the people who supported me in this and regardless of the result will not be the last time I'll code art :D .

A new challenge to start the year...

Well my initial thought as I explained in the description of the project was to map the emotions, I like to map things, I like Node.js and I like social networks and in particular the model of Twitter, because I feel that there is a tendency to say what we dare not mention in person more than any other social network, and all through 140 characters.

The creative part of this case will be the color patterns (or markers) that will be generated each product mood (more than 20 types of emotions that I want to crawl into the English-speaking population) but to make it special, I propose #emotionalmap as hashtag for this project, and also to measure the interest, that people want to share with me their moods and become part of a large canvas (in this case the map) when already running.

To make it more appealing to the viewer that the individual may want to filter the results using voice commands with Web Speech API, the spectator can look at where there are more happy or sad people, anxious people, fearing people... maybe even we can to answer these people with whom we share certain moods.

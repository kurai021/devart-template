Yesterday I was aware of some minor glitches, in the first place "Emotional Maps" stopped working product that Twitter was under maintenance. 

Second, a bug at first I thought it was just on iOS and now ends up affecting all mobile devices that use Webkit. I Speak of the property "overflow: auto / overflow: scroll" which is not rendered correctly and makes the div "Legend" is completely off the screen. So I'll have to find a quick solution if I want all devices to display my artwork properly or decreasing the number of devices in which this may work.

## Description
Emotional Maps, is an effort to map people according to their emotions, based on the content of their tweets (English only) in real time.

Analyses like these might give us a clue of where there are more happy people , where there are sad people, could help us learn more about persons, their motivations, the things they like or the recurring themes depending on their geographical area or even prevent unfortunate events.

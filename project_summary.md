## Description
Emotional Maps, is an effort to map people according to their emotions, based on the content of their tweets (English only) in real time.

Analyses like these might give us a clue where more happy or else, where people are sad people, could help us learn more about people, their motivations, the things they like or the recurring themes depending on the geographical area or even prevent unfortunate events.
